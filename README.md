# protobellum
Wage a war with autobots

A simple concept game that spawns armies (two by default) and pits them against
each other. Some metrics (e.g., troop numbers) are randomly determined.

The game is designed such that it can be easily extended to allow for more
armies, predetermined troop sizes, a more powerful client-server design, more
user control over attacks, etc.

The game uses no outside frameworks (except for some limited jQuery).
